# Flip A Coin

A simple web-based coin flip simulator that allows users to flip a virtual coin and track counts of heads and tails.


## Description

"Flip A Coin" is an interactive, animated web app that simulates the real-world experience of flipping a coin. This project incorporates smooth coin flip animations with real-time statistics on how many times heads or tails have appeared. It's designed to be both intuitive and visually appealing for users of all ages.


## Features

- Simulates a realistic coin flip animation.
- **Interactive Coin Flip**: Click the **Flip Coin** button to simulate flipping a coin.
- **Heads & Tails Counters**: Tracks and displays the number of times heads or tails have appeared.
- **Animation Effects**: Smooth, visually appealing coin-flipping animation.
- **Responsive UI**: Optimized to fit various screen sizes, from desktops to mobile devices.
- Clear feedback with **Heads/Tails** stats in real-time after every flip.


## Tech Stack

The project uses the following technologies:

- **HTML5**: Provides the structure and content of the web page.
- **CSS3**: Handles responsive design, styling, and animations.
- **JavaScript**: Brings interactivity, coin flip logic, and real-time counters to life.

## How to Use

1. Open the project in any modern web browser.
2. Locate the **Flip Coin** button in the interface.
3. Click the **Flip Coin** button to see the coin flip animation.
4. Observe the smooth animation and check the counts for **Heads** or **Tails** as the flip concludes.


## Demo

Here are images representing the coin flip outcomes:

### Heads Example
![Heads Example](./demo/heads.png)

### Tails Example
![Tails Example](./demo/tails.png)

These images represent the coin's animation for heads and tails results respectively.

## How It Works

1. When you click the **Flip Coin** button:
   - A random decision is made between **Heads** or **Tails** using JavaScript's random number generation.
2. The coin animation runs to mimic the effect of a physical coin flip.
3. After the animation completes:
   - The respective count is updated in real-time.
   - The status label shows whether the flip resulted in **Heads** or **Tails**.


## Key Features of the Code

1. **Randomized Flip Simulation**:
   - A random number determines whether the result is `heads` or `tails`.
2. **Animation Integration**:
   - CSS animations are triggered dynamically based on the random outcome.
3. **Real-time Stats**:
   - A running count of flips for both **Heads** and **Tails** is dynamically updated and shown on the UI.


## Future Improvements

Planned features and enhancements for the next release:

- Add sound effects during a coin flip to enhance realism.
- Introduce advanced stats visualization (e.g., pie chart representation of results over time).
- Allow users to customize UI themes.
- Enable coin flip history tracking for users to analyze trends.
